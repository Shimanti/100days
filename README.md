# 100 Days of Code 
I'm going through 100 days of code for JavaScript and React projects (mostly).
I can't say I'm following a plan, but I plan to build, build, build within that time.

- Day 1 = NYT Bestsellers list with static content and no API use, using JS.
- Day 2 = Amazon data - basic review analysis, using python/pandas
- Day 3 = NYT Bestsellers list with API using JS, https://bestsellers-nyt.netlify.app
